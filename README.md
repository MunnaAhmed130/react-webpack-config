# react-webpack-config

First install project dependencies -

```
npm i
```

Then, run this terminal command to run webpack -

```
npm run build
```

To visualize bundles run -

```
npm run stats
```

For revising this project look up vidoes from swashbuckling with code.

This project is for me to understand webpack, loaders, plugins etc.
